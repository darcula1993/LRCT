# LRCT

This project contains code to extract training examples from raw data and train classifier stack on ELMO,ULMFit,Google universal sentence encoder, and BERT.

The BERT model was forked from BERT original repo. The specified fine-tune process is defined in the run_classifier.py.

The other transfer learning framework are developed in train_elmo_umifit.py.
