In a recent blind test, where participants were asked to choose search and choose Bing or Google without knowing which is which, they chose Bing 2 to 1. I personally use Bing everyday.

1,"Bing finds my web site easily, Google doesn't! Google has gone downhill in recent months - presumably they have changed their search algorithms yet again. Now it seems like sites that have multiple listings of environmental consultants are more likely to be on the first page than a consultancy that offers exactly what was required in the search. OK, I could try (again) to optimise my web site pages to suit Google, but that take a lot of time. I think on the current trajectory Bing will prevail. However, Google Scholar is still good for my work, so I won't abandon Google entirely. Phil Smith, Aquatonics Ltd",Bing is better than Google,1

3,"Bing isn't being properly judged. Nearly every individual who prefers Google to Bing is a biased party. This is because those who hate Bing often use Google and never use Bing. Google ""fan-boys"" don't really know what Bing has to offer, and in many cases, have either never, or very rarely, ever used The Bing Engine, and thus, are ineligible to compare the two.",Bing is better than Google,1
4,Back Button Problem When I use Google it will not let me simply use my back button like it was supposed to work. I have to always hit it 2 or more times in fast order to simply go back one page. When I use Bing the back button works perfectly. I have read many posts that this is a problem with the Google program. I have used Google search for years and I have loved it. I am using Windows 7 on my laptop and I am now using Bing search. I like Google better when it used to work but Google is now forcing me to use Bing because Google will not reply to my questions and it appears that they can not fix this problem.,Bing is better than Google,1
5,Bing found our baseball website I tried to search for our baseball website in both Bing and Google after submitting the url to each site. Bing found it but not Google... Even after repeatedly submitting the url to Google it still will not find it... So I would say Bing is better in this case!,Bing is better than Google,1
6,"It's really prejudged It's quite ridiculous, to be frank, Bing has vastly improved since launch, I mean, it has some brilliant features that Google doesn't, and to be honest, Google is starting to feel dated, the search results don't seem to appear quite as fast, and either way, people should stop arguing. :)",Bing is better than Google,1
7,"Bing is better Bing = less ads and more privacy. Google has become too invasive with information (which is why I stopped using Google Drive). Microsoft is a software company while Google is an ad company. Bing has vastly improved it's search engine. It's interface is very simple with minimum ads. Thou I still believe Google still has better apps such as Google Maps and Google Translator. But ""Search Engine"" wise. Bing FTW.",Bing is better than Google,1
8,Bing is better because you get more accurate results and they have cool features like their backgrounds and whats happening recently in news and entertainment. People that prefer Google haven't used Bing. People that are used to Google use Bing just for one day and I guarantee you that you will have a better experience. I used to not use or like Bing but I recently started using it (but I still have Google as my homepage). But in the end Bing is better than Google.,Bing is better than Google,1
9,"Bing is Better than Google in many ways... Googleites are a lot like the old Appleites and can't see past the nose on their faces. I've used both and while I get OK search results from both, I don't care for the major advertising associated with Google. I am also put off by companies paying Google to raise their presence in searches. I have also read that if you search for something like Doritos, you will see many ads for Doritos. I also do love the cool crisp interface of Bing.",Bing is better than Google,1
10,"Bing Was Made By Microsoft Need I say more? Windows is made by Microsoft and everybody knows how bad that works. On the other hand, we have Google. A website that has been around since 1988. Bing has only been around since 2009. Bing's results are overly complicated. Google keeps the results simple. Google also has fun tricks. If you google up ""do a barrel roll"" for example, the google result page will do a barrel roll for you. If you search in ""do a barrel roll"" on Bing, it just gives you results of it. Same thing for ""zerg rush"" if you search it in on Bing, it does nothing. However, on Google, it gives you a game to play on the results where you have to click the o's to kill them before they eat up your results on Google. If you search up math equations you can put in on a calculator, Bing will just give you links. If you search it in on Google, it will give you a mini calculator with the result on the answer screen. On the home page for Google, they have interactive doodles on holidays, for example during the London 2012 olympics. Everyday of the olympics, Google had a doodle on their homepage where you play a game as if you were in the olympics. Bing's homepage just consists of professionally photographed images and a trending bar at the bottom. The Bing commercials say that more people prefer Bing over Google. Don't believe them, because more people prefer Google.",Bing is better than Google,0
11,"Google Is Better Google is much better than Bing. There is a reason why ""Google that"" is a common phrase. I have experience with both and Google is much more user friendly.

13,"Do they have a movie about Bing? No, Just Google. Google has been around for much longer and in my opinion has better results. People who like Bing most likely like it cause the page is ""pretty to look at."" I tried Bing and heck my computer came pre-installed with Bing and it didn't have the feeling of ""googliness"" (quote from the actual movie ""The Internship"") that only Google can offer, They even made a movie with Google called "" The Internship"". Google also has doodles for Google, an amazing contest for kids of all ages to enter and have a chance to win $30,000 college scholarship, and a $50,000 technology grant for their school! How generous does that sound? Oh, wait but surely Microsoft has a contest to win a free Xbox or scholarship, right? WRONG because Microsoft is a money grubbing selfish corporation and I am no Sony or Nintendo fanboy or anything cause I own an Xbox 360 and have had Xbox live for 5 years. But that's not to say Bing is the worst thing ever, I and a lot of my friends just prefer Google and all their services like YouTube and Gmail. Overall I would highly recommend the solid and great services offered by Google. I would then recommend Bing if you like to stare at baby monkey's and rainbows while you search.",Bing is better than Google,0
14,"The look may be better It's true that Bing may be more appealing to the eye (at first). But Google has better shortcuts and better protection.

15,Much More Friendly Google changes their logo every time a holiday or some important event is on that particular day. Bing doesn't take the time to show that they actually care.

16,"Duh! You should already know. Google is dominate than bing because one of popularity. Bing pay people to say bing is better than google. Google is popular with searches.

Now that is sad.",Bing is better than Google,0
17,"Because Bing is lying to people. Bing has directly challenged Google with the site 'BingItOn' but when you compare the results they provide to real Google results they don't match. It also doesn't have widely used email, search engine, or hardware structures.

18,"Google > Bing Google, as the world's #1 search engine, can easily best it's relatively new competitor, Bing, in the race for search engine domination. As Google has made itself a common verb in our everyday lifestyle, it's hard to imagine life without Google. A quarter-trillion dollars in net worth, Google is the largest online information service provider on the globe. Bing has few of the perks Google has to offer, such as the many comprehensive applications provided by Google. Google Maps is invincible, with its transit directions and most up-to-date information. Google Drive competes directly with other online storage applications. Google Mail, naturally shortened by most users to, 'Gmail', can call itself a major success. Not many services on the Internet can provide Google's vivid and graphic-rich Google Earth, even with the option to soar over the world and other planets in a 2D interface. Google provides doodles for important national and international events, also running petitions to protect the anonymity and safety of the worldwide web. Few can offer anything close to the company that has done it all; Google.",Bing is better than Google,0
19,"Survey says no. I've always been a huge fan of Google, but as part of a survey recently I did take the Bing challenge.

23,"Yes, but only if used responsibly. Phones can be used to facilitate learning, if used correctly and responsibly. Our maths teacher introduced us to an app for revision and learning, for instance. And a friend of mine regularly used his phone as a calculator.

29,"They don't need them. Tho the word ""child"" is vague as it could mean anyone from the unborn (with child) to fully grown adults (my children have kids of their own), I will use the legal definition of human between the ages of birth and puberty. This is basically grade school and younger so they would have responsible adults/teens around at all times. If some situation comes where a call needs to be made, This older person could and would make such a call so the young child does not need their own phone of any kind. Kids, Especially the very young, Get distracted easily. Getting kids to eat or do chores is hard enough without them having some distraction within easy reach. Creating social skills is important to early development and by phone is no substitute for personal interaction. Today, We see teens texting each other within the same room when they could be having an actual conversation. Is this trend something we want to encourage?",children Should  use smart phone,0
30,"It's not good for them Children are spending FAR too much time nowadays on mobile phones. Sure, Technology is moving on, But then children are growing up far too quickly as well. I don't see why if kids want to meet up, They can't use the telephone. I mean, That's what has been used before and it worked fine, So why use this technology? Social media should have proper age limits too. Children are being told what to do by a screen. It's simply not healthy. Phones should have age limits when buying.",children Should  use smart phone,0
31,"It depends what you mean by ""children"" I believe anyone under the age of 11, Possibly 12 don't need a phone. Most of the time kids that age just use them to play games, So they should just get an iPad, PC, Or console instead. Children that age don't need to have easy access to the internet through messaging and browsing because they aren't ready to deal with the people and the things they will encounter. Anyone 13 and over though should have one though, Because by that point they may want to do stuff like go out with their friends without parental supervision, So it would be good for them to have a device to be in contact with their parents. They will also hopefully by this point be responsible online and not watch mindless toy review content on YouTube.",children Should use smart phone,1
32,"Yes, But limited Let me explain. The phone must be limited so that it can only make calls / receive calls. This is actually possible using smartphones (app lock), But for simplicity, You can give your kid a stupidphone. No games, No videos, No internet. Just calls, In case they need something or there is a problem. After a certain age, There can be less limitations on the phone, Since the kid understands more and is more responsible (depends on the kid though :D). One other idea instead of locking the unnecessary apps it could be a surveillance app, So that the parent can see what the kid does all the time / how much time is spent on the phone etc. Then it's up to the parent to decide what to do.",children Should use smart phone,1
33,Yes But not too overboard Anyone age 9 and up would likely be responsible enough to have a phone 馃摫. They can call their parents when they want to be picked up from school. They can also contact their friends if they are feeling lonely. Sometimes the kid needs to wait for something so they can play on the phone until a parent or friend comes. They should have a phone if they鈥檙e responsible enough. The parent can put restrictions on what apps they can download and use,children Should use smart phone,1

But once it becomes a routine or something that is done to someone by the same person or the same group of people, then it is a serious matter. And it only becomes cyberbullying when it is done repeatedly and constantly.The Internet was built for easy access to information and for communication.

It is very widespread, for about 43% of kids have been bullied online. Think about that for a second. There are 323.1 million people in the USA alone. 43% of that is 138.933 million people.

40,"People give too much of a crap of what is said on the internet. It is so easy to say things on the internet that one would not usually say aloud. If i said every thought that i have had, so many people would be offended and/ or be hurt, but there is something notable about thinking something and then hearing oneself say it that causes one to think about what he is thinking to say. With the internet that process is missing the step of saying things aloud and thus thinking about what one is thinking to say and every thought is vomited out and is typed. Hopefully that made a slight bit of sense... This generation is too dependent on technology and they are searching to find identity all over. They are desperate to find worth and they look all over for attention. This is why drugs, sex, money, changing sexual preference, and changing identity/gender is so prevalent today; its because everyone is looking to fill the hole they feel in them so that they can get through this evil cruel world. It is also why people join radical groups and let themselves get brainwashed; they want to be part of something that gives them the impression that they are needed. But to get back to the topic yes cyber bullying is a real thing. People need to take into consideration that we all come from different backgrounds and we are all wired differently and what is a trivial comment to one may be the most offensive slander to another.

The iPhone 8 just went off a generational cliff for iOs where the operating system was actually slimmed down to account for a last generation chipset. Because of this, It is actually functioning better today than it was when it was first introduced. The X series iPhones are still technically in late stage development and more prone to bugs and security vulnerabilities. 2. As it went over the two generations old mark, It garnered additional price cuts and can be found on clearance in many stores which might pride themselves in only carrying the more modern devices. Because of this it is entirely possible to find a new iPhone 8 for less than $300. Although it may not have all the same features, It's still an incredible device, Actually performing processes FASTER than X series phones.

When people say that iPhones are overpriced, I feel that is untrue because though many android phons are cheap, They lack the functions more recent iPhones have. However, If you pay a premium price for a newer high end android phone, Both the price and quality will rival a iPhone.",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,1
65,"IPhones are simple to use IPhones are much more simpler to use than an android. Android users argue that you get to customize your phone. But I don't want to add complex features to my Samsung, I just need a phone that can run Facebook, Not a phone that has some gizmo I won't use. Plus, Android is hard to disable features, Unlike the iPhone. IPhones are just simpler to use.",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,1
66,"IPhone's are super fast. Undoubtedly, Speed is the utmost priority for cell phone users and iPhone is the fastest phone presently. Sharing my personal experience, It was quite hesitating for me and it took years to switch from android to iPhone but after using iPhone I've decide to use it for the rest of my life. It's true that iPhone is not much user friendly and it restricts you in downloading and data sharing but in fact this is the secret which makes it the fastest and safest phone.",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,1

68,"IPhone's are iconic. Looking back in history as we move into the future iPhone's are remembered, There's a story behind how the company went from a garage to San Fransisco. Apple has always sold more than just technology they've sold because it's socially more accepted and they look better. Apples moto has always been think different and no matter how small the difference is, It will always be there. (btw I have google pixel)",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,1
69,"Apple is all for the name Apple is a cheap way of saying ""I got a phone, And its really good"" but in reality android is much better. Apple is over-all favorite but break it down and think about it. . . Apple made a phone with an EXTRA LENS but whether as android has three lens, THREE and that was about a year before apple even had good cameras. Now here we have a iphone WOW IT HAS A FACE CAMERA UNLOCK OMG, Buuuut android already has it LOL",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,0
70,Cheap doo-doo. Expensive as hell just for the brand name! The main thing I dislike about Apple's products is that they slow down older devices just to get you to purchase the most recent one. Then you have the endless versions that come out with shittier features. I've only had one Samsung phone before being unable to afford it and got a TracFone which I am much more content with.,Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,0
71,"IPhone - Outdated, Overpriced, And completely Underwhelming I was a massive Apple fan growing up and even throughout university I exclusively used Apple products. After switching to Android a few years back what more can I say. . . Apple is outdated and overpriced for the value they deliver. The only thing Apple likes to improve is the size of its pocket.",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,0

73,IPhones are overpriced IPhones aren't much easier to use and have almost the same power as other phones. The only difference is that IPhones are $600 more expensive than other phones. If you want a simple phone to do simple things there are quite cheap Trac phones that at least still have a normal charger and a headphone jack.,Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,0
74,"No IPhones are overpriced for less Iphones are much more expensive for the same phone just at lower quality, More expensive repairs, And no compatibility with anything non apple. The reason many people buy apple is because they are trapped into the ecosystem where everything is only compatible with apple and the consumers can't get out.",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,0
75,"Arguments in pro of iPhones superiority are now outdated, Android phones have caught up technology wise While in the past iPhones have had better technology faster, We have to recognise that argument for what it is: outdated. Other brands (such as Samsung, Huawei; etc. . . ) are currently releasing state- of-the-art technology for the decimated price of Apple's iPhone. Where apple used to win with AI, Fingerprint sensors; etc. . . These are now common things that are integrated into any good android phone. In several cases the android phones actually have better technology than iPhones. Aside from this, IPhones are very constricting. Most people will just want the newest model, Leading to a giant group of people having the same phone, A blatant erasure of the individual. Especially since iPhone doesn't allow you to customise your phone besides changing the background. IPhone forces you to use its own music player, To have various useless apps taking up space (to motivate you to buy a bigger and more expensive model) and further employs capitalist methods to make people buy more Apple products (such as removing the headphone jack, Having an exclusive charger; etc. . . ) All of this for a brand name. . . And I haven't mentioned the huge prices Apple employs, To ""bring you the best"", While other brands prove that what Apple serves is certainly not the best, And that the prices are incredibly unfair. While at one point you could've justified buying an iPhone by naming its technological superiority, Nowadays it's better you make an educated decision and buy an android.",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,0
76,"Androids give users more freedom. Apple phones are way too expensive and way too simple to use. Although the design looks good, I still don't understand why are people obsessed with iPhones. Apple literally pressures everyone to buy special chargers, Special headphones, Music etc. It's a waste of money in order to have an apple on the back. Plus, The iOS is kind of unadaptable while Android has a lot of options open for users. Why buy an ordinary iPhone for 1000 dollars just because it's cool and has cool marketing instead of buying a 4 times cheaper Android that could be such as good as iPhone (maybe even better)?",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,0
77,"Androids can actually be really nice phones As everyone knows, Apple makes really nice phones. Although, Android can be equally as good. Take the Galaxy S9 for example. It's a great phone and has a iris scanner and a face scanner to unlock. Dose Apple have that? I don't think so. Another thing is that apple has HUGE prices. With Android, Prices can be very low and still have nice phones. As you can see, Apple is not better than Android.",Is Apple's iPhone better than the Android phones,0
