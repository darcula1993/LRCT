This README file contains the original corpus and the annotated corpus as utilized in Wacholder et al. (2014) and Ghosh et al. (2014).
There are four separate folders in this release. 

*Original* contains the blog posts as well as their comment sections (Section 2 in Wacholder et al.,2014).

*expert_annotated* contains the annotations of the expert annotators. The annotations contain specifically the "Target", "Callout"
texts and their start/end points (utilized in measuring inter-annotator agreements and Clusters). For more details about "Target", "Callout"
please refer to the papers and the annotation guideline in the *docs* folder.

*docs* contains the guideline for expert annotations.

*turker_annotated_task1* contains the data used in "Categorization of Arguments" task as reported in Ghosh et al. (2014). We have
provided a separate README file inside the *turker_annotated_task1* folder for more information regarding the "Categorization of Arguments"
task. Please cite (Ghosh et al., 2014) if you use this part of the data. 

(Note, we will provide the annotated data from the 2nd AMT annotation task ("Analysis of Stance and Rationale" - ref. Ghosh et al. ,2014)
in our next data release.)
