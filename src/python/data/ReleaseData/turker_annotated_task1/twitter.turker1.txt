What you skim read was an  article explaining some points why twitter has it problems.  And I must tell you I agree with some, not all, but with some of them. Because rather than say I  dont tweet, he really explained why.  Twitter shouldnt be a cult and we must see it less bright side."	choice3	choice3	choice3	choice3	choice1

I like the  fact I can see whats the latest thing going on; and search realtime deeper. I like the fact, I  can get first person views on things. I like following celebrities, CEOs, etc. to see how their  lifestyles are. I follow all my friends and I can know exactly whats going on by watching their  tweets and what they plan to do that night or whats going on during the week.  I have TechCrunch on sms alerts to my phone for any tweets. I feel like I am always in the loop."	choice3	choice3	choice3	choice3	choice3

To paraphrase Douglas  Adams  The number of Tweets generated is infinite since manymost are generated automatically, we can  assume this will only continue and grow exponentially to be an infinite number. The number of  valuable Tweets is finite.  Any finite number divided by infinity is zero or a number  infinitesimally larger than, but never equal to, zero, or fI1I."	choice1	choice1	choice1	choice1	choice1
