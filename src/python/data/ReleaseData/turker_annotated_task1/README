This README file contains information about the "Categorization of Arguments" task as reported in Ghosh et al. (2014).
First we describe the task-description as posted to Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform and then describe the associated corpus.

*******************************************

1. Categorization of Arguments

In this experiment, you are presented with a pair of text spans acquired from a discussion forum in a technical blog.
In every pair of text spans, the 2nd span is a response to the first text span, which we call a "Target". Your task is to categorize this response
(i.e. the 2nd text span) as either a) clearly agreement, b) probably agreement, c) probably disagreement,
d) clearly disagreement, or e) None of the above. Categorize the selection based on your impression about the 
response to the first text span (i.e. the target). Here are a short definition of the categories for your peruse.

Clearly agreement: The response definitely agrees with the first part. 
Probably agreement: The response seems to agree with the first part. 
Probably disagreement: The response seems to disagree with the first part. 
Clearly disagreement: The response definitely disagrees with the first part. 
None of the above: I can't tell, or, none of the answers above seem appropriate.

2. Corpus Description

As reported in Ghosh et al. (2014), four sub-corpus are utilized for the categorization of arguments tasks. Corpus files are
tab delimited and the first rows in the files depict the columns. For more information regarding "Callout" and "Target", please
refer to the paper and/or the slides (Ghosh et al. (2014)). The sub-corpus are :-
-- android100.turker1.txt
-- ipad.100.turker1.txt
-- layoffs.100.turker1.txt
-- twitter.100.turker1.txt

Note, choice1 represents "Clearly agreement", choice2 represents "Probably agreement", choice3 represents "Probably disagreement", 
choice4 represents "Clearly disagreement" and choice5 is "None of the above". The Categorization of Arguments task, as reported in the paper
was done by combining choice1 and choice2 into a single category ("agreement") and similarly choice3 and choice4 were combined
into the category "disagreement". 

Also note, even if we have another sub-corpus called "ban100" in the original folder, we have not run any AMT experiments
with this sub-corpus.
