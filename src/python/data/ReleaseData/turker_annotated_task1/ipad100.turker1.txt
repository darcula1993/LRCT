It's still in testing stages, it's still  dependent on Google writing drivers to address the hardware in specific laptops and you may or may  not want to use yet another laptop just because it's a netbook.  The thing that is funny to watch is when netbooks came out there was this perception that everyone  was going to toss out their current laptop and instantly buy a netbook. When that did not happen,  those who did toss out their laptop went OH DANG!!! I miss my laptop and then had a netbook which  made it to craigslist and a laptop that they went back to because it never did enough for them.  iPad does solve a problem. It provides a platform for those of us who use our iPhones or Touch's to  do certain things but wish that the screen was larger at points in time. It's not a full laptop but  it has a screen that puts ANY netbook to shame and speedwise was quite impressive.  Sure ChromeOS when it comes out will be nice in some regards and fill some niche. However when your  email goes out via GMAIL it is on the web and you cannot get to it. We've seen this with Gmail  outages time and again. The iPad can either leave your email on the server of me.com or on your own  hosted servers, or it can probably inhale it and then synch it back somewhere else later on.  ChromeOS competes with WindowsXP, VISTA, 7. It does not stack up against OSX or the iPhone OS which  is out there on millions of platforms (touchs, iphones, and soon iPads). It will be slow in getting  out there, no matter how many people say differently as we've seen things take time to entrench  before.  iPad will sell.

I used the OOffice Writer quite a lot 2-3 years ago,  Impress just a bit until I got VERY annoyed by it and Calc just for basic stuff. I also know MS  Office quite well and for a real power user, that's the one. However, since iwork 09 is out, I use  it alot and by now I prefer it in every way. It actually has every feature I really need and those  that I need are by FAR better implemented than in OOffice and most of the times even better than MS  Office in terms of simplicity. There are some crucial benefits like the positioning rulers that pop  up, or the alt-arrow-key combination for inserting rows/cols that make often used actions so much  simpler, you ask yourself how you could have lived without it. Even numbers has become great, if  you don't need pivot-tables it's probably all you need, again, and there it's much simpler. Also,  MS Office import / export is SO much better than in OOffice.

It has multi touch, it has 32gb SSD, SD slots, USB ports, audio ports, web cam, tablet mode, multi  touch track pad, fast, 6 hours of battery life, and oh yeah it's only $550.  How can the iPad be considered better, what because it runs Windows 7? A normal PC OS? That is not  a problem, as you can get tablet specific applications if you want, there just is no need for them."	choice3	choice1	choice3	choice3	choice3
