The simplicity of  android and its ability to multitask make the iphone a useless toy.  Heck even the oldest  smartphone of them all the Blackberry can multitask.	choice1	choice1	choice1	choice1	choice378	2CUNHMVHVKCNA3WBPUVJG9KQZNT53G	Except for games  ??iPhone is clearly dominant there.	Jason -  Do you know why the Pre was able to get big games companies to come onboard when it is a wasteland  in the android world? Did they pay them off? Is it various handset/builds/resolution issues?	choice5	choice3	choice5	choice1	choice579	20QEBDPGFL6ZMRRQWEED5IOV4903IP	navigation  on the iPhone is always one app deep at a time	"reminds me of something i read about the original macos interface, where one had one  window per folder open.  it worked fine as long as one had a mostly flat and casual usage scenario. But once one scaled the  usage up, the number of windows open to reach a specific file exploded.  all in all, it seems that the apple designed interfaces work ok for casual use, but never really  scale."	choice5	choice1	choice1	choice1	choice180	2CUNHMVHVKCNA3WBPUVJG9KQZNT53G	"When I want an option that isn't already visible, I hit the  dedicated `Menu' button just beneath the screen.  Need to jump to a previous screen in an app or  the web browser? Hit the dedicated `Back' button.  In some ways, these are actually better than the  soft buttons located in iPhone apps, because they're always in the same place.  It also saves some  screen real estate.  Using them has become totally second nature to me.  But they aren't the reason  why I've decided I prefer Android over the iPhone.  Which brings me to the things that have turned me into a full-time Android user.  Gmail on Android  kicks the pants off of the iPhone's Email client???something that I'm not the &lt;URL/&gt; only person to  notice.  As someone who does a lot of Emailing, that makes a *huge* difference to me.  Google Voice  integration is fantastic.  The ability to run multiple applications at the same time is a breath of  fresh air.  Those three things were enough to seal the deal."	"All the stuff the writer of this article mentions are much more intuitive on webOS, but he acts as  if Android is the new Jesus. Wonder if the folks at TC ever get paid or receive promotional items  from companies they push. It's the only way to explain how they can write what they have above  about Android while having severely dismissed in the past.  You don't have to unlearn or relearn behavior with a Palm Pre. You just swipe your cards."	choice3	choice3	choice5	choice3	choice581	2MX3Q0JG5TYQXERPYR0FISSSKETFJL	the dedicated `Back' button	that back button is key. navigation is actually much easier on the android.	choice1	choice1	choice5	choice1	choice182	2LNUUKQOYGNM63IJVB70A07SYX2YGX	I feel like your comments about Nexus One is too positive to be self-thought.
