141	The United States is where all this technology started.  We shouldn't have to move  to another country to get a job.  The jobs originated here and should stay here.	Is that a bad thing adobe_alum? Moving to India?	0
0	the ones badmouthing microsoft here, do you guys ever actually use a machine for work?	Microsoft have a lack of vision. Maybe this will kick start `em -- but it's a catch up game with  them.	0
264	With the iPad now clearly aimed at netbooks...  Sorry, the iPad isn't competition for a netbook. The iPad isn't a personal computer. It's a  web-browsing/book reading device, which is also a vehicle for AAPL's content.	With the iPad now clearly aimed at netbooks	0
248	You are an incredibly rude bore. I hope you lose you lose your job during this bleak market.  Most  of those let go are not blaming others, but wondering how a once-stellar company with decent ethics  wound up making such stupid mistakes, and making those who worked their butts off for them, pay the  price for their incompetence.  You must work in an HR department. Better hope you never find yourself out of work when  unemployment is over 10%, and you have to worry about keeping a roof over your kids' heads and food  on the table.	You sound like my grandfather bickering about young people taking over his factory job.	0

243	Crazy much?	Wipro paid Tom Friedman to write The World Is Flat. It's not an idea book, it's a  pro-India PR piece. Just wait until all the Adobe work goes to India and Adobe ends up with  Vista-like products. Do you think sending a lot of its engineering work to India has been good for  Microsoft? It's been a disaster. Google Quark debacle. Did I mention Apple closed all its R&amp;D in  India in 2006? Did I mention Apple is booming using mostly American R&amp;D? Reasonable costs are  useless if the products are so bad no one wants to buy them. And shovelling tons of money into a  country that has centuries-old resentments against the west and then arming them with nuclear power  might not be the best idea in the world. What are the *long term* implications of doing so?  Cost-cutting used to be a sign of a company in trouble. Now it's all the rage. But the world econ  doesn't seem to be doing too well since cost-cutting took over, does it? Destroying the world's  consumer base through cost-cutting can only lead to more disaster.  More software comes from Scandanavia than from India. Where is the Indian OS? Nearly all sotware  projects in India fail and are brought back or canceled. Sending software work to India is the kiss  of death for any company.  Name one new modern technology to come from India.	0

47	It's obvious by two moves where Adobe THINKS they wanna go:  1/ Acquire Omniture for twice what it was really worth (6x premium on 300m in revenue, normal  `going rate' is 3x, for Omniture that's being generous),	Here's my impression of Abobe:  Hey, I have a great idea! I'll spend 1.8 BILLION dollars to take over a company [Omniture] that has  literally NOTHING to do with myself. If that's not genius, then the definition needs redefining.

98	On the N1, I just click on the Market icon, and it takes me to a Market with pretty  much all the apps I use. EverNote, Pandora, Foursquare, etc, are all there. Oh -- and a number of  timers to make up for the lack of built-in timer. Not as many apps as the iPhone but I don't need  85 fart apps.	Where do you actually get the apps? &lt;URL/&gt; http://www.android.com/market/ is so sparse  and ugly i have a hard time believing its the official store? Am i wrong?

[few months later]  Holy *S**T*, what was I thinking?!?! This was the stupidest acquisition ever. Almost as bad as eBay  buying Skype -- but thankfully, no acquisition could top that one when it comes to complete  mindfucks, so at least I'm not the stupidest company on the block -- but I'm still pretty god damn  stupid.  We're bleeding red and need to trim some fat before the shareholders rip us a new asshole. Eh,  what's 1,000 lives to flush down the toilet? HR, write up some pink slips and tell these pricks to  get the fuck out of my face. Maybe they'd still have a job if i didn't waste 1.8 BILLION dollars on  a stupid acquisition, but I'm not going to admit that. I'M ADOBE, BITCH!	1
247	So you re saying that iPad, a product that won't be for sale for a another two months,  don't have a software catalogue available today ? Wow, that's surprising!  The future looks different though. Omni just announced that they will port five products to the  iPad, at least two of which that might do the trick for what you want to do.	they're still playing catch up with  real applications	0

81	You are right on XBOX 360 -- but wrong on everything else?  Windows 7? C'mon that was just an expensive service pack to Vista. Where is the innovation in that?  Office 2010? Ribbon? Really? It's so hard to use that Microsoft had to make a game so people could  figure out how to use its features.	looking at the Xbox 360, Windows 7 and Office 2010 you appear to be flat out wrong	0
308	Japanese students beat Indian students in NASA science contest  So much for the best and brightest from India -- and so much for Japan not graduating enough  scientists and engineers. Japan's kids just beat the pants off India's.	That pot of gold is Japan. They are pumping the same fake  news stories into the media to try to convince the Japanese to let them in in large numbers.	1
132	I'm sure Microsoft is watching ... I just can't wait for them to bring something innovative  in the near future.	Microsoft have a lack of vision. Maybe this will kick start `em	1
145	You know Linux is the kernel, the stuff around that is GNU, and on top of that  is Gnome, KDE, or Android and ChromeOS.	Chrome OS and Android run on top of the Linux kernel.	1
165	I wish i was stupid enough to prove you wrong, but I wont, money is goood hehe, no need for  competition here.	Think about it from a developer's standpoint.  With Apple, you could develop something on the  iPhone or iPad first, and then tweak it a little bit to work on the other device.  You only have to  think about a max of two platforms, both with a huge base of users who have demonstrated that they  are will to pay good money for quality apps.  Then look at Google.  You could develop something for Android, and there's no guarantee that it  will even work on all android phones.  Plus, they have not done a good job training their users to  pay for apps, so you'll hardly make any money even if it's one of the best apps on the platform.   And then you can't leverage any of your android hard work on Chrome OS because the two have even  less in common.  If developers are the difference between success and failure (as a different TC post has said  today) then Apple has already won.  It's the ecosystem.	0
10	I remember Apple telling people give the UI and the keyboard a month and you'll get  used to it.  Plus all the commercials showing the interface.  So, no, you didn't just pick up the iPhone and know how to use it. It was pounded into to you.	You just knew how to use the iPhone from day one.	0
60	it quickly turned into a massive broadcastlink machine  Exactly! I wrote a column myself like the post above, about having similar sentiments  lt;URLgt;   Twitter is a suckers game that only serves the needs of a tiny elite  The heart of it was that I didnt want to be cog in that broadcastlink machine. Many people didnt  seem to grasp that point, and I got a lot of flack replying basically youcanchat! But I dont  want to chat in little public snippets.	it quickly turned into a massive broadcastlink machine	1
254	Illustrator went to India years ago. Since then the  entire Print Publishing BU was outsourced, not just the engineering, but the marketing as well,  went to India. Much of the localization team went to India, as well as China. IT has moved  completely to India. All the Web production work is done from China. Adobe is outsourcing more to  China at this time than India.  A small empire was built in the Adobe China location last year.	In all these years Adobe outsourced only one big project to India --  Illustrator.	0
196	Seems like people don't agree with you fanboy!	the iPhone is  a truly great design.	0
316	I believe twitter is more of a link to news site.  Meaning that most of my 140 characters are  usually used for a hyperlink to some information I believe is useful to me at least, and  therefore, hopefully useful to others.  I was a big opponent of twitter until I started using it  regularly and following the people that I find interesting.	As for spreading news, there I can see it might be helpful for some.	1
285	well isn't the defining characteristic of a netbook its price, even more than its size?	It was too expensive	0
115	Hah.  If you think Republicans are the answer you're are barking up the wrong tree.   For the most part, they are way, way more free trade (the market will sort it out) than the  Democats.	we  have another year before we can put a stop to the powers that are destroying the US economy	0
24	This is funny, cause the way i heard of this article was through a tweet.	tweets are valuable	1
228	Agree with rick and turnbull --- target markets are not the same, so no collision except for a  small group of users sitting on the boundary fence. Soccer moms will love the iPad. Techies not so  much.	the iPad isn't competition for a netbook	1
278	First of all I tweet, and I know why I do that.  However that dont stop me from arguing that you can be so plain white. What you skim read was an  article explaining some points why twitter has it problems.  And I must tell you I agree with some, not all, but with some of them. Because rather than say I  dont tweet, he really explained why.  Twitter shouldnt be a cult and we must see it less bright side.	Of course we just skim read it.	0
191	Apple has got loads of competition on the hardware-side, but the only ones who's got a  clue software-wise is Google. Chrome and Android is closing in on macos / iPhone os.	How can the iPad be considered better, what because it runs Windows 7? A normal PC OS? That is not  a problem, as you can get tablet specific applications if you want, there just is no need for them.  Just admit that the iPad is not innovative, and stop drinking the Apple koolaid.	1
84	That is the most beautifully demented thing I've read all week MG didn't write.	Especially true when you read garbage like this &lt;URL/&gt;  http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/01/09/google-android-personal-thoughts.	1
255	Are you kidding Did you think we Tech Crunch readers actually read the articles  We look  at your pictures and deduce the point of your post from them and them alone... psssss... read...  HAHAHA.... anything more than 140 characters is just boring.	Are you guys all part of the same speed reading club?!	0
40	Or why not someone else from TC write an article with title Why I Use Twitter	as punishment for writing this longwinded and defamatory article	1
310	It will help in that it will prevent swiping through screens to get to the  previous app icon on the desktop.  But it's not the same thing since unlike the Android, the  previous state is lost and you are restarting the app.	a button that pops up links to the where you were in  the last three apps or the home page	1

34	Are you seriously giving Dane Cook credit for its funny cause its true  I  dont know if they originated it, but it was on lt;URLgt; The Simpsons in 91.  Chances are they  didnt get it from a 19yearold Cook.	its funny cause its true  Dane Cook	0
274	There is no official Android market.  Combined with Google flipping off the phone companies by obsoleting a product in a couple of months  then bypassing them entirely by direct sales, that sure sounds like a recipe for domination against  the iPhone.	There is no official online Android Market.	1
220	The new Indian Nazism  The exact same thing that led to the rise of Hitler's Third Reich and Japan's imperialism of the  1930s is now rising once again this time in India and China.	I would say  laying off Americans and moving their jobs to India is adversely impacting the wages and working  conditions of America. Since Narayen is from India, that makes him an INADMISSIBLE ALIEN under  Title 8, Section 1182 and he should be deported immediately. Since when do Indians understand the  concept of laws. If I were one of you laid of Adobe workers, I'd be getting a lawyer and suing  Adobe under U.S. laws that specifically prevent these kinds of crimes against Americans.	1
218	Are you serious? You're going to blame the immigrants for you losing your job?	This is foreign takeover folks.	0
113	So in summary, comparing either quality or quantity of apps is pointless.  Umm, do you have another metric?	Comparing absolute numbers of apps is stupid	0
276	wants everyone to move towards using iPhone OS-based apps. or you could say they wanna bring  people inside their tightly controlled ecosystem.	Apple, as they made clear  with their overly-long iWork for iPad demo on Wednesday, wants everyone to move towards using  iPhone OS-based apps.	1
78	Why do iPhone fanboys even bother?	Actually the only one responsible for the YouTube and Twitter multitasking is the  app's developer.  The Facebook app allows you to watch  videos posted by friends in the YouTube app  and once its done it returns you to the same place you were in on Facebook.  To fix this you simply  could write a couple of negative reviews about the app (in the app store on the phone or computer)  and more than likely it will be addressed in the next update.  I think it hilarious that people complain about features that arent even available on another  device (my iPod touch doesnt feed me and wipe my arse).  Like the reviewer said, it seems you can?t  find a related review, blog post, or tweet that isn?t gauging the device based on how it compares  to Apple?s juggernaut.  This is because Apple was the first to do it and they still continue to be  the industry leader.  These iPhone Clones are playing catchup.  Good luck with that.  Marcus get a Zune, then you wont have to worry about apps, you ungrateful schmuck!	0
17	good to know, I have been able to really use the iPad for more than a few minutes, so I  have to defer to your experience with it.	netbooks are better than the ivagina	1

330	Wipro paid Tom Friedman to write The World Is Flat. It's not an idea book, it's a  pro-India PR piece.	the world is flat, remember?	0
331	Yeah, absolutely. Coming from iPhone it's a bit strange but after a few days you get the  hang of how it (the back button) works and suddenly everything is awesome.	that back button is key	1
302	The Use Cases of a netbook and a tablet are completely different. If typing is your thing, then  a netbook will suit. If you want a device that is easy to use on PT, a cafe, at meeting, or  collaborating  then a tablet will prove to be more useful.	it remains to be seen if people who buy an iPad will do so instead of buying a netbook	0
231	With the proper tax credits and other incentives, this wouldn't be happening.  But we  have another year before we can put a stop to the powers that are destroying the US economy.	jobs are going to  India.	1
18	Could you tell me one feature about OpenOffice that you need, that's better implemented  than in iWork (or even doesn't exist there)? I used the OOffice Writer quite a lot 2-3 years ago,  Impress just a bit until I got VERY annoyed by it and Calc just for basic stuff. I also know MS  Office quite well and for a real power user, that's the one. However, since iwork 09 is out, I use  it alot and by now I prefer it in every way. It actually has every feature I really need and those  that I need are by FAR better implemented than in OOffice and most of the times even better than MS  Office in terms of simplicity. There are some crucial benefits like the positioning rulers that pop  up, or the alt-arrow-key combination for inserting rows/cols that make often used actions so much  simpler, you ask yourself how you could have lived without it. Even numbers has become great, if  you don't need pivot-tables it's probably all you need, again, and there it's much simpler. Also,  MS Office import / export is SO much better than in OOffice. Give it a try!	used  (Open)Office suit of apps where serious work is needed	0
96	Microsoft had a net income of around 14.5 billion USD in 2009, not 3.05 billion USD.	Microsoft's $3.05B	0
209	Then you have nothing to fear about. If outsourcing gives no economic value, it will  fade away, won't it?	you get what you pay for	0
129	Furthermore, where is the Indian OS? They've had a decade of the best IT  training in America, and supposedly unlimited brilliant IT people in India. Surely such a brainy  country can come up with its own OS and put MS and Apple out of business right?  Where's the OS India?	Innovation is  not part of their culture.	1
48	I enjoyed working at Adobe a great deal and had hoped to become a perm employee.  But they did  tell me the main reason I got cut was because I was the last US developer on the team; after our  lead moved into his new role, everybody else (including QA) was in India.	This is foreign takeover folks.	1
185	Even if Shantanu is a naturalized citizen, his loyalty still lies  with India since he is from there.	If somebody can prove to me that Shantanu is a naturalized US Citizen,  then I'll shut up.	1
211	Did I ever say I was a consultant? I said I had my own company.	You are a consultant ?	0
116	By now we all know that India, Inc. pulled a fast one on America in 1998 by  hiring professional PR/lobbying firm Hill &amp; Knowlton to pump news stories into the U.S. media  claiming dire economic calamity unless the U.S. opened up to mass immigration. 	China/Japan lead the way FYI.	0

179	Imagine if the iphone implemented multitasking today.  The phone wouldn't be so speedy, would it?  And how long would that already too short of a life battery then last?	no multitasking on the iPhone	0
8	There are a few Amercians left. At one point they had laid off all the Americans and  sent the whole project to India where it was rewritten in Java. That was so bad they had to  ressurect the old code and start the project back up in the states.	most of developers in Acrobat team are Americans	0
202	At least it's a quickly growing collection.	It's more  about the  features and apps and Android seriously lacks on latter.	0
9	And less memory.  And no expansion ports.  And no option to run an IM app in the  background while you are creating a document.  So, no....it is far from a netbook equivalent.	it will definitely compete with this class of device	0
258	Dy took er jbs!	Dey took ar jobs!	1
336	All the stuff the writer of this article mentions are much more intuitive on webOS, but he acts as  if Android is the new Jesus. Wonder if the folks at TC ever get paid or receive promotional items  from companies they push. It's the only way to explain how they can write what they have above  about Android while having severely dismissed in the past.  You don't have to unlearn or relearn behavior with a Palm Pre. You just swipe your cards.	When I want an option that isn't already visible, I hit the  dedicated `Menu' button just beneath the screen.  Need to jump to a previous screen in an app or  the web browser? Hit the dedicated `Back' button.  In some ways, these are actually better than the  soft buttons located in iPhone apps, because they're always in the same place.  It also saves some  screen real estate.  Using them has become totally second nature to me.  But they aren't the reason  why I've decided I prefer Android over the iPhone.  Which brings me to the things that have turned me into a full-time Android user.  Gmail on Android  kicks the pants off of the iPhone's Email client???something that I'm not the &lt;URL/&gt; only person to  notice.  As someone who does a lot of Emailing, that makes a *huge* difference to me.  Google Voice  integration is fantastic.  The ability to run multiple applications at the same time is a breath of  fresh air.  Those three things were enough to seal the deal.	0
