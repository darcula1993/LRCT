Brilliant imported Indian managers like Bhavnani who have to ask Americans where he can get  the MSDN CD from. Not only that but Bhavnani didn't even know how to play the Indian IT griftology  racket -- after being laid off, he asked me to come back to work for one week only to train my  slumdog replacement.

Their software is junk,  they've thrown out all the Americans out who created the company, and the place is filling up with  3rd world losers. In a few more years expect Adobe to end up like Sun bleeding red ink. Thanks  imported guest workers. You sure are brilliant. You sure are keeping America competitive.

88	The reason that I am developing educational content for the iTablet/iPhone is  that a 3 year old can pop it open and use it.

105	Think about it from a developer's standpoint.  With Apple, you could develop something on the  iPhone or iPad first, and then tweak it a little bit to work on the other device.  You only have to  think about a max of two platforms, both with a huge base of users who have demonstrated that they  are will to pay good money for quality apps.  Then look at Google.  You could develop something for Android, and there's no guarantee that it  will even work on all android phones.  Plus, they have not done a good job training their users to  pay for apps, so you'll hardly make any money even if it's one of the best apps on the platform.   And then you can't leverage any of your android hard work on Chrome OS because the two have even  less in common.  If developers are the difference between success and failure (as a different TC post has said  today) then Apple has already won.  It's the ecosystem.	Google wants  everyone to move towards doing everything on their apps in the cloud. Apple, as they made clear  with their overly-long iWork for iPad demo on Wednesday, wants everyone to move towards using  iPhone OS-based apps.	0

138	A tip for the editor...  The Chromium OS team (the base of Chrome OS) is working on Tablets, Netbooks, Notebooks, and PC  Desktops.  That's include... high resolutions desktops, multitouch support, accelerometer, and four (4) user  interfaces for Chromium.  Read the Open development page of Chromium OS for more info.	But the obvious strategy for this used to be that Google would attack Microsoft from the bottom  with its Chrome OS netbooks, while Apple attacked from the top with their premium computers, &lt;URL/&gt;  leaving Microsoft squeezed in the middle. With the iPad now clearly aimed at netbooks thanks to its  pricing and Apple's positioning, everything is &lt;URL/&gt; different.&lt;br /	0

249	But still, I don't exactly consider netbooks and the iPad to be on a collision course. My mum wants  an iPad because it has a big screen and has intuitively limited functionality, and I want a netbook  because I just need something that I can easily type on and customise the experience to what I want  and need.  Same position in the market (in between phones and regular computers) but not on the same paths in  my opinion.	The iPad And Chrome OS Netbooks Are On A CollisionCourse	0

68	I'm sorry to say, but these racistcomments about Adobe letting Americans go, and  keeping Indians, Chinese, etc, is true. The vast majority of people let go are over 40 and  American-born.

IN the last 18 months, the Indian office  and Chinese office have been on a hiring frenzy.	just exposing what's going on inside the doomed company.	1
49	Like the reviewer said, it seems you can?t  find a related review, blog post, or tweet that isn?t gaging the device based on how it compares to  Apple?s juggernaut.  This is because Apple was the first to do it and they still continue to be the  industry leader.  These iPhone Clones are playing catchup.  Good luck with that.

214	That's refreshing to read. You've described what's wrong with many reviews on tech blogs these  days. After reading some of the Nexus One reviews I've noticed a negative tone, partly related to  the massive hype it got and then reviewers feeling underwhelmed, but it also seems like some people  are mad it's not an iPhone.

It's still in testing stages, it's still  dependent on Google writing drivers to address the hardware in specific laptops and you may or may  not want to use yet another laptop just because it's a netbook.  The thing that is funny to watch is when netbooks came out there was this perception that everyone  was going to toss out their current laptop and instantly buy a netbook. When that did not happen,  those who did toss out their laptop went OH DANG!!! I miss my laptop and then had a netbook which  made it to craigslist and a laptop that they went back to because it never did enough for them.  iPad does solve a problem. It provides a platform for those of us who use our iPhones or Touch's to  do certain things but wish that the screen was larger at points in time. It's not a full laptop but  it has a screen that puts ANY netbook to shame and speedwise was quite impressive.  Sure ChromeOS when it comes out will be nice in some regards and fill some niche. However when your  email goes out via GMAIL it is on the web and you cannot get to it. We've seen this with Gmail  outages time and again. The iPad can either leave your email on the server of me.com or on your own  hosted servers, or it can probably inhale it and then synch it back somewhere else later on.  ChromeOS competes with WindowsXP, VISTA, 7. It does not stack up against OSX or the iPhone OS which  is out there on millions of platforms (touchs, iphones, and soon iPads). It will be slow in getting  out there, no matter how many people say differently as we've seen things take time to entrench  before.  iPad will sell. I am planning the things to add to mine already when it's home with me in around 90  days.	The iPad And Chrome OS Netbooks Are On A CollisionCourse	0

119	Theres a lot of hype and so in the long  run Twitter may not change the world but the model is here to stay. In the end, it may also not be  Twitter that wins but the space and may be somewhere else.  But as an example, people will always follow celebrities for the same reason that they read and  watch TMZ. Its also very useful from a local business model, Ive found it particularly useful for  finding deals.  Finally, the search engine is very useful. When Clinton freed the American journalists in N. Korea,  Twitter was the best place I found to verify this when the news broke. Thus, throws on ads there  and monetize. I defintely see the value to the service. People should question market size,  structure and potential winner not so much viability of model.	a tweet is fundamentally valueless	0

82	Slashdot has an article on a new $100 Android netbook that looks pretty reasonable to me.  The  lack of proper background multitasking on the iPad is a killer for me, as is the lack of a built-in  memory port of any kind.  I'm ordering one ASAP just to play with it, but it'll probably gather  dust like my iPhone 3G and my iPod Touch that I bought to play with and gave up hope on.	Now, it remains to be seen if people who buy an iPad will do so instead of buying a netbook. At  first, &lt;URL/&gt; I'm not so sure that will be the case. But it stands to reason that eventually, this  will happen. And as Jobs' comments on stage on Wednesday made abundantly clear, that's Apple's idea  too. In their eyes, you shouldn't buy a cheap, underpowered PC, you should buy an iPad, their  anti-netbook.	0
182	More than value for business, Twitter takes most of your time. Once you get caught  in the flurry of tweets, youre lost. Theres no escape for you. Again, if you are away from  Twitter, you lose.

199	To pretend like eliminating the Apple monopoly on the  hardware/software/everything isn't going to give Android a nudge up in the line over Apple is  completely shortsighted.

118	Yes, there would be some good applications for the iPad for a lot of things, but they'll always be  behind what's out there, both in quantity AND quality because there's simply a limit to what a  limited number of developers can do, and there's a limit to how many applications you can cram in  one store, and there's a limit to how many apps the Apple approval staff (or bots or whatever they  are) can review...	if you compare what's  available for Chrome OS to the iPhone App Store	1

245	To Everyone that thinks the iPad is so much better than a netbook, and that there are no  other multi touch devices. I tell you to look at the Asus T91MT.  It has multi touch, it has 32gb SSD, SD slots, USB ports, audio ports, web cam, tablet mode, multi  touch track pad, fast, 6 hours of battery life, and oh yeah it's only $550.  How can the iPad be considered better, what because it runs Windows 7? A normal PC OS? That is not  a problem, as you can get tablet specific applications if you want, there just is no need for them.	With it, they feel that they've created a $500 (for the baseline version)  device that is superior to every netbook out there.	0

318	+3 ..someone is trying desperately to convince us why we need to buy this device not matter  if we wont do sh$$t with it.	Next thread on AppleCruch: iPad: Buy it, because we're telling	0
109	Amen!	Its really pathetic when someone in the  Internet era says, that Twitter is the only way you can find a blog post.	1
282	Is that a bad thing adobe_alum? Moving to India? I agree one should not leave the  comfort of home, but at times like this, it doesn't hurt to travel a bit. Look at all the indians  who do that as well. A business that is global should not necessarily be rooted to one place/region  right? And ppl from all places are welcome to move around.	I may have to move to India to get a job!	1
124	Here's my impression of Abobe:  Hey, I have a great idea! I'll spend 1.8 BILLION dollars to take over a company [Omniture] that has  literally NOTHING to do with myself. If that's not genius, then the definition needs redefining.  [few months later]  Holy *S**T*, what was I thinking?!?! This was the stupidest acquisition ever. Almost as bad as eBay  buying Skype -- but thankfully, no acquisition could top that one when it comes to complete  mindfucks, so at least I'm not the stupidest company on the block -- but I'm still pretty god damn  stupid.  We're bleeding red and need to trim some fat before the shareholders rip us a new asshole. Eh,  what's 1,000 lives to flush down the toilet? HR, write up some pink slips and tell these pricks to  get the fuck out of my face. Maybe they'd still have a job if i didn't waste 1.8 BILLION dollars on  a stupid acquisition, but I'm not going to admit that. I'M ADOBE, BITCH!	Adobe &lt;URL/&gt; acquired Omniture	1
259	The thing about Twitter is that it started as a really cool idea  a cloud of  consciousness unfolding before your eyes.  Everybodys cloud was different.  It can become a cloud  of spam if you let it, but you dont have to let it.  I never follow anyone who follows me unless I know them or their tweets are of some interest to me.   Thats the beauty of it  you dont have to follow anyone.	its become this bullshit marketing tool for  social media experts	0
7	Oh yeah, that's why Apple has been able to provide a good fix for its busted 27 iMacs, huh?	At least with an iPad you get real customer service	0
268	They do... if you hold the home button down for a long press, you see the  previous 6 apps that you ran.	a button that pops up links to the where you were in  the last three apps or the home page	1
266	I totally disagree.  I am a mobile phone design industry veteran.  I have an iPhone, a  Milestone and a Nexus One.  It is plainly obvious to anyone that uses them that the iPhone is on an  entirely different planet of usability....simply brilliant.  The two Android phones I have are,  simply, rubbish.  The icons are tiny and fiddly, the menu layouts contravene even the most basic  user interface design rules, they have faster processors but from are user perspective appear very  clunky.	I prefer Android over the iPhone.	0
252	once you get the hang of it...  but this is the point isn't it? You just knew how to use the iPhone from day one.	Once you get the hang of  navigating between apps	0
319	to say the iPad lacks innovation because a few  features are missing is ludicrous.	the iPad is not innovative	0
158	Interesting, then, that I was alerted of your article via Twitter. Would you argue that the  140 characters that led me to your article were useless	a tweet is fundamentally valueless	0
193	Iphone is good not doubt,but something can't be better then Iphone is a falsey.	the iPhone is  a truly great design.	0

53	lol just tired of ppl demanding me to justify myself for using a service. Hes doing  the exact thing that he thinks is annoying himself.	They are not insulting you or your being	0
221	I am also very, very frustrated by the iPhone, so much that i have no more excuses to keep it.	I prefer Android over the iPhone.	1
107	and what makes you think that Microsoft is not working on a similar device right now. As a  matter of fact, we have all seen Courier. If that is not real then something on  the lines will  come up.	leaving Microsoft squeezed in the middle	0
178	I've really never had an issue with apps. Comparing absolute numbers of apps is stupid at  this point. While it is true that the iPhone seems to have more high quality apps, I can't think of  a case where I couldn't find a comparable (albeit less polished) app on Android.	It's more  about the  features and apps and Android seriously lacks on latter.	0
